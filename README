Main.jack errors:
        I tried to create an array of square objects and it did not work
        Also tried to make another squares class(please see folder) that is an object that holds an array of squares, but that didn't work either.
        
        The error message is always: "In subroutine main: Expected ("
        Therefore I have to make squares one by one.
        

        /*let squares = Array.new(maxNum);
        while(num<maxNum){
        	do Output.printString("num = ");
        	do Output.printInt(num);
        	let squares[num] = SquareGame.new(index_x, index_y, size);
        	let temp = squares[num];
        	do temp.fall();
        	let num = num+1;
        }
        let num = 0;
        while(num<maxNum){
        	do squares[num].fall();
        	let num = num+1;
        }
        let num = 0;*/
